# <Homework-2-employee-payroll-tracker>

## Description

This project objective was to update a JavaScrip file to create an interactive Employee Payroll Tracker. A collectEmployees function was created to prompt the user to enter employee data and then that data was stored in an object and then an array to be accessed in future functions. The creation of the displayAverageSalary function was to accept the employees array with inputed data, to access the salary for each employee in the array and then find the average. Finally, the getRandomEmployee function accesses a randomly determined index of the employees array to award that employee with a prize.

## Usage

This project can be used by anyone who wishes to keep track of their employee data, as well as determine the average salary at their company, and randomly choose an employee for an award.
